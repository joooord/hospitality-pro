# Hospitality Pro - Master Plan

## The Vision
A comprehensive, all-in-one hospitality management application.
Built first for "Hidden" (a premium, speakeasy-style cocktail bar in Middlestown), but designed agnostically to serve any hospitality business.

## The Aesthetic
Premium, dark, editorial, restrained. Clean typography. Liquid-glass UI elements where appropriate. Zero friction. It must be usable by a bartender mid-shift or a manager doing prep at 2 AM.

## Core Modules to Build

### 1. The Cocktail & Costing Engine ✅ SHIPPED
- Deep Math: Calculate true cost per serve.
- Target Margin: Input desired GP%, output recommended retail price.
- ABV Calculator: True ABV% in the glass.

### 2. Labor & Scheduling (Rota Optimizer) ✅ SHIPPED
- Wage model with live staff roster, shift assignment, and hourly burn tracking.
- Forecasted revenue input with automatic labor % + risk banding.
- Local-first persistence so rota data survives refreshes.

### 3. Inventory & Ordering ✅ SHIPPED — Supplier Automation Console v1
- Live PAR tracking against liquidGlassInventory ingredient database.
- Shortfall calculations → auto-generated order sheets grouped by supplier.
- Supplier database with contacts, delivery days, min orders, lead times.
- One-click copy/print of ready-to-send order lists.
- Spend forecasting per supplier + per order.

### 4. Daily Operations ✅ SHIPPED
- Opening and closing checklists.
- Prep lists (what to batch, what to prep).
- Maintenance logs.

### 5. End-of-Night Cash & Revenue Reconciliation ✅ SHIPPED
- Till reconciliation: Expected cash vs actual denomination count. Cash variance banner.
- Cash/card split with visual bar. Float in/out tracking.
- Comp & void logging with type tags (comp/void/manager discount).
- Daily GP snapshot: Auto-pulls wage cost from Rota Optimizer localStorage, live GP% ring.
- Historical log: localStorage persistence, date filtering, band filtering, click-to-reload.
- End-of-night summary: One-tap copyable/printable report for WhatsApp/email.
- Mobile-first, Liquid Glass dark premium aesthetic. Close in under 3 minutes.

### 6. Review Management
- AI-assisted review responses (Google/TripAdvisor).
- Sentiment tracking and trend analysis.

### 7. Food Waste Audit Tracker
- Log waste events (item, quantity, reason, value).
- Weekly waste value vs theoretical waste allowance.
- Trend chart — top wasted items, root cause tagging.
- Pairs with Supplier Automation Console for intelligent re-ordering.

## Infinite Loop · Immediate Next Build
**Staff Tip Pool & Distribution Calculator**
- `tools/tip-pool/index.html`
- The biggest manual nightmare at end of service — zero good tools exist for small venues
- Directly pairs with the EOD Reconciliation Console (same workflow, same moment)
- Input: total tips collected (cash + card), staff on shift, hours worked per person, role weights (bartender vs server vs barback)
- Logic: weighted distribution by role tier + hours — fair, transparent, auditable
- Output: per-person tip amount, printable/shareable breakdown, localStorage history per night
- Pair with EOD: pull tonight's date automatically, link back to that night's close
- Mobile-first, Liquid Glass, sub-60-second to complete

## Execution Strategy
- **Autonomy**: Jim and the agents will continually build, test, refine, and deploy this app without asking for permission.
- **Iteration**: Every feature gets a v1 shipped fast, then polished based on the aesthetic guidelines.
- **Delivery**: Continuous deployment via Vercel. Code must be robust and error-free.

## Live Deployments
- **Production**: https://hospitality-pro.vercel.app
- **Repo**: https://github.com/joooord/hospitality-pro

## The Infinite Loop Protocol
At the end of every task list, the system MUST execute the following sequence indefinitely:
1. **Research**: Analyze the current app state, user friction points, and modern hospitality tech trends.
2. **Plan**: Formulate the next phase of the Master Plan. Expand the scope.
3. **Implement**: Build the new features or polish existing ones to an "amazing" standard.
4. **Check & Debug**: Ensure zero errors, perfect mobile responsiveness, and accurate math.
5. **Ship**: Commit, push to main, and deploy to Vercel.
6. **Repeat**: Return to step 1. Do not stop.
